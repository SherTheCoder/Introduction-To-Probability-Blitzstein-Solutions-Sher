We can think of the problem as sampling with replacement where order matters.

There are $6^{30}$ possible sequences of outcomes. We are interested in the cases 
where each face of the die is rolled exactly $5$ times. Since each sequence is 
equally likely, we can use the naive definition of probability.

There are $\binom{30}{5}$ ways to select the dice that fall on a $1$. Then, 
$\binom{25}{5}$ ways to select the dice falling on a $2$, $\binom{20}{5}$ 
falling on a $3$, $\binom{15}{5}$ falling on a $4$, $\binom{10}{5}$ falling 
on a $5$ and finally, $\binom{5}{5}$ falling on a $6$.

Thus, the desired probability is $$\frac{\binom{30}{5} \binom{25}{5} 
\binom{20}{5} \binom{15}{5} \binom{10}{5} \binom{5}{5}}{6^{30}}$$ 

Alternatively, imagining the sample space to be a $30$ digit long sequence
of $1, 2 \dots 6$, we want the cases in which each of $1, 2 \dots 6$ numbers
appear exactly five times. There are $\frac{30!}{(5!)^{6}}$ ways to arrange 
such a sequence. Hence, the probability is $$\frac{30!}{(5!)^{6} 6^{30}}$$
