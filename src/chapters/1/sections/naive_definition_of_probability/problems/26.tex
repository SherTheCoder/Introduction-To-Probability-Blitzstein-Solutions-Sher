\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
\item  The problem is isomorphic (having same structure) to the birthday
problem. When sampling with replacement, each person corresponds to 
a date in the birthday problem, and the size of sample corresponds to
the number of people in birthday problem. Hence, taking a random
sample of $1000$ from a population of a million corresponds to asking
a thousand people their birth date where there are a total of a million
dates. Number of ways to take such a sample is $K^{1000}$ where $K$ is
size of population.
Similarly, number of ways to take sample without replacement corresponds
to number of ways of having no birthday match in that situation:
$K(K-1) \dots (K-1000+1)$

\item $$P(A) = 1 - P(A^{c}) = 1 - \frac{K(K-1) \dots (K-1000+1)}{K^{1000}}$$ 
where $K = 1000000$.
