There are $4$ choices for sizes and $8$ choices for toppings, of which any
combination (including no toppings) can be selected.

The total number of possible choices of toppings is $\sum_{i=0}^{8}\binom{8}
{i} = 2^8 = 256$. Thus, the total number of possible size-topping combinations
is $4 * 256 = 1024$.

We wish to sample two pizzas, with replacement, out of the $1024$ possibilities.
By Einstein-Bose, there are a total of $\binom{1025}{2}$ choices.

A common mistake is to use multiplication rule to get $(2^8)*(2^8)$ as 
total possible combinations for two pizzas, and try to adjust for overcounting
by dividing the result with 2 (as order between pizzas doesn't matter). This 
fails because the possibilities with identical pizzas are counted only once.
